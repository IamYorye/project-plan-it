this morning I got my code functioning and updated my merge request. My partners confirmed the code is working and I merged to main. I then got started on the next job of creating the user_stacks backend API. since i spent so much time creating the other back end I learned a lot and this was much, much easier to code and implement. I've already got most of it working and think I'll be merging before the end of the day.

I am still trouble shooting code but I believe I finally have it working. I created my first merge request and my partner Libby immediately found the code wasn't functioning properly and found where the issues were. I had some issues with merging with the main and made some mistakes that took a couple hours to correct. I believe I've found the problem and am working on a fix.

I've overall completed the coding for the FastAPI and necessary functions and now I'm trouble shooting. I realized there are issues with some of my naming conventions and inconsistencies. I also need to add in better trouble shooting and error functioning. I'm also trying to work with Gabe a bit and see if we can align our code more with naming conventions. It is obvious two separate people created the code simply because of how we are naming and a few other differneces in how we've implemented.

I am still working on the backend API for Projects. As it's my first time using PostgreSQL language I'm having to take additional time learning the various aspects of not using a framework like Django for my API. I had some issues with my docker container but I did some trouble shooting and I have it working now.

We divided back end duties. Gabe and I are splitting the back end API to develop Projects. I will be doing two GET functions and the PUT function. I have started by creating two files, projects.py under queries and routers folder. I plan on making the quieries first and make models and define functions, then will move on to the routers and create teh FastAPI
