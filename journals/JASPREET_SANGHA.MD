Yesterday we set up our yaml file and created our database in the migrations file.  Created the volumes for each volume in the yaml file and docker-composed up to see all the containers running without any error.  As for today, for the majority of the day, Brad, Libby, Gabe and I all worked on our portions of the endpoints.  I was able to finish all of the endpoints for accounts and tested them out to make sure no errors occurred.  I was able to create an account with the correct output, get all of the accounts that have been created in a list, get a specific account by passing in an id, delete an account by passing in an id, and update the content of an account by passing in an id.  Some blockers occurred with some validation errors, but nothing google and the learn concepts couldn't fix.
